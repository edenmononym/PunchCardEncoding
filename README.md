# Punch Card Encoding
FORTRAN punch-card encoding ported to Processing.

Encoding is based on IBM Model 026 keypunch, a "workhorse of much early work in business data processing" [1]. Used extensively from July 1949 through the early 1970s. This program uses the FORTRAN character set.

**VIABLE SYMBOLS**  
    `0-9, A-Z, +-/='.)$*,(`  

I have also added `;`, which is not part of the FORTRAN set, but let's us write some Processing sketches :)
